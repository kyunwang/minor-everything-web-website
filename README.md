# Website Minor Everything Web CMD (re-design)

Challenge:
A few self imposed challenges. I will try to adhere as much as possible to accomplish these.

- Make all functionality in HTML & CSS only
- Try to refrain using JS for core functionality

Extra note:

SCSS approach: Easy to maintain, duplicate assignments
Global changes will be a hassle
