# Website Minor Everything Web CMD (re-design)

_Doc/Progress in progress_

Challenge:
A few self imposed challenges. I will try to adhere as much as possible to accomplish these.

- Make all functionality in HTML & CSS only
- Try to refrain using JS for core functionality

The editor code comes from my fellow from the minor [here](https://github.com/baskager/redesign-minor-web-dev/blob/develop/app/src/js/the-wow-header.js)

Extra note:

SCSS approach: Easy to maintain, duplicate assignments
Global changes will be a hassle

## Introduction

A re-design of the Minor Everything Web (Web Development) at HvA by the course Communication and Multimedia Design (CMD). Re-design started based on this [website](https://cmda.github.io/minor-everything-web/) of 20-04-2018 (Dutch)

Redesign can be found [here](https://kyunwang.github.io/minor-everything-web-website/)

Principles:

- Trying to interest not to sell (directing to reviews)
- Act as if it is a new product

Design principles:

## User scenario

Bas is an third year IT student looking for a minor to **complement** his skillset. He has a decent amount of knowledge about HTML, CSS and JS apart from python, but he wants to **learn about design** to make full circle. As Bas wants to learn more about web design, he needs to know whether this minor is **suitable** for him to learn about it.

Marc is an ICT student looking for a minor

He is mainly focused on the back-end part of the web and reckons that styling is not so hard. The catch is that he mainly uses bootstrap to do his styling.

## Re-design focus

## Design

The design process in pictures can be found below.

Starting from card storting to sketches, design and ending with design feedback.

### Card sorting

Sorting current content and restructuring

### Sketches

Random sketches (not the most organized I must say)

### Design feedback

## User test

## Principles

- Keep users in control

- One primary action per screen - Exception of a specific context ish break

- Provide a natural next step

- Consistency matters - can be used to _break_ attention/context for a specific goal

- Strong visual hierarchies work best

- Smart organization reduces cognitive load
