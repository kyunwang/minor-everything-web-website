# Website Minor Everything Web CMD (re-design)

_Doc/Progress in progress_

Challenge:
A few self imposed challenges. I will try to adhere as much as possible to accomplish these.

- Make all functionality in HTML & CSS only
- Try to refrain using JS for core functionality

The editor code comes from my fellow from the minor [here](https://github.com/baskager/redesign-minor-web-dev/blob/develop/app/src/js/the-wow-header.js)

Extra note:

SCSS approach: Easy to maintain, duplicate assignments
Global changes will be a hassle
